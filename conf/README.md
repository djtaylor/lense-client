Server Configuration
=========
You should place your modified 'server.conf' file in this directory. You can create a copy from the 'docs/examples/server.conf' file and make any appropriate changes for your environment.

Default Configuration
---------
The file 'server.conf' found in the 'default' directory contains a configuration file with default configuration settings. Any directives found in the user's 'server.conf' file will override values found in this file. See the file 'default/server.conf' for all configuration options.
